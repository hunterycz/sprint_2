# Module 3 Assignment Questions

### How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL?
* Working with MongoDB was different because I didn't have to focus on making sure theres in a primary key or also have to write a schema to keep track of how each table is connected to each other. I can also see the uses for MongoDB if you don't know what type of Database you want to write you can kind of use MongoDB as a playground before deciding.

### What was easier, and what was harder?
* Initially I would say MongoDB because connnecting to the database was very different than SQL or PostgreSQL, but after getting some practice I would say MongoDB is definitely easier and doesn't require as much as SQL.
